# AgentBoard build progress

Source of truth for the design: `SPEC.md` (revision 2). This file tracks where the build is in the commit plan (SPEC section 19), the exact check status, and every deviation from the spec with its reason. A later builder continues from here.

## Commit plan position

| # | Commit | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | chore: pin toolchain and gate it with strict tsc and workerd smoke tests | done |
| 2 | chore: Vite 8 React 19 app with the Cloudflare Vite plugin, Hono worker, wrangler environments and generated types | done |

Next: commit 3 (`feat(db): console and people D1 migrations`).

## Check status (last run)

- `npm run typecheck`: pass
- `npm test`: pass (2 files, 3 tests: toolchain gate in `worker` and `worker-ws`)
- `npm run types:check`: pass
- `npm run build`: pass

## Deviations from SPEC.md

1. **Test entry module.** The toolchain gate needs an Agent with a `schedule()` callback and WebSocket state before any production agent exists. Instead of adding a probe class to the production worker, `vitest.config.ts` sets the plugin's `main` to `test/helpers/test-worker.ts`, which re-exports the production worker and adds a test-only `ToolchainProbe` agent (bound through `miniflare.durableObjects`, routed under `/__probe/*`). Production code never imports it. Files not in the SPEC layout: `test/helpers/test-worker.ts`, `test/helpers/probe-agent.ts`.
2. **`tsconfig.web.json` arrived with commit 2**, not commit 1: TypeScript refuses a project with no input files, and `src/web` did not exist before commit 2.
3. **Port 8784 instead of 8788.** This machine shares ports with other builds, so the built worker (`serve:built`, `eval:sim`) listens on `127.0.0.1:8784`, and the dev `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists `http://127.0.0.1:8784`. The Vite plugin's inspector is pinned to 9234 for the same reason.
4. **Skeleton agent classes in commit 2.** `wrangler.jsonc` declares all four Durable Object classes from commit 2 so its shape (one `v1` migration tag) never changes; the classes are empty `Agent` subclasses until their commits. The queue handler retries every message (fails closed) until the consumer lands in commit 13.
5. **Production worker name.** Wrangler names the `production` environment's worker `agentboard-production` (it appends the environment name), so the production `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` placeholder is `https://agentboard-production.<subdomain>.workers.dev`. Keeping the suffix means an accidental top-level deploy can never overwrite the production script.
